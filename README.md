# CSS-JS-Mini-Projects
This repository contains small practice projects I built to refresh my fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
While I have worked on large-scale MERN stack applications like:

ðŸŽ¥ Video Conferencing Website,
ðŸ“± Social Media Platform,
ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Store,
ðŸŽ¬ Jio Cinema Clone,

Believing that strong fundamentals make better developers, I create mini-projects occasionally to sharpen my skills.
