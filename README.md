# CSS-JS-Mini-Projects
This repository contains small practice projects I built to refresh my fundamentals in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
While I have worked on large-scale MERN stack applications like:

ðŸŽ¥ Video Conferencing Website
ðŸ“± Social Media Platform
ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Store
ðŸŽ¬ Jio Cinema Clone

I also believe strong basics are the key to becoming a better developer, so I create mini-projects regularly.
